Not managed to update the blog for a few months, which is a shame, because I quite enjoy doing it. I've also had a few emails from satisfied customers. Some of you out there actually take the time to post feedback. Much appreciated. Though I had to code a spam filter for naughty stuff that had been submitted. Thankfully I now don't have to go into the database, and bulk delete entries.</p>\n<p>Now that I've got the time, I'm going to start writing again. I start work again in the new year, and I'm looking forward to it. As things never stand still in development, it'll be time to pick up a few books, and gain some new skills.</p>\n<p>More Content Management integration coming up for me next year (<a href=\"https://www.sdl.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Tridion</a>, possibly Immediacy), and more <a href=\"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ASP.Net</a> work. Also going to brush up on my <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">jQuery</a>, and <a href=\"https://codeigniter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CodeIgniter</a> knowledge. Really would like to do more Open Source based project work, as I've been mainly using proprietary applications during the pass few months. With the economy lower than a fat kids self esteem, I can't be choosy, just glad to be working.</p>\n<p>Have a great Christmas, and I'll see you a few pounds heavier in the new year.</p>\n","cover_image":null}},"context":{}}
