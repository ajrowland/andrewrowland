I couldn’t find anything specific to help me, so had to locate all the information separately. Hopefully the following may be of use to anyone who has to go through the same. In my situation, I have 3 servers that will sit behind a load balancer. The following describes how I set up each server.</p>\n<p>Initially I thought it best to update all packages on each Amazon Linux AMI. I was using a green field environment. You might not be in that situation, so may not want to do the following.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo yum clean all\nsudo yum update</code></pre>\n<p>Solr 5 requires a newer version of Java that was pre-installed on the server. So we need to obtained an updated Java package, and select it as the default version.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk\nsudo alternatives --config java</code></pre>\n<p>Now we need to obtain a Solr package. You can find a mirror here: <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/mirrors-solr-latest-redir.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://lucene.apache.org/solr/mirrors-solr-latest-redir.html</a>. For example, I downloaded an archive using:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">wget http://mirror.catn.com/pub/apache/lucene/solr/5.1.0/solr-5.1.0.tgz</code></pre>\n<p>Let’s make certain all the pre-requisites exist to run Solr, but decompressing the archive, and running it.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">tar zxf solr-5.1.0.tgz\ncd solr-5.1.0\nbin/solr start\nbin/solr status</code></pre>\n<p>If Solr looks like it is running correctly, let’s stop it.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">bin/solr stop</code></pre>\n<p>We can now install it using the pre-packaged service install script that comes with the archive. Exit the Solr folder, and extract the service install script.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">cd ..\ntar xzf solr-5.1.0.tgz solr-5.1.0/bin/install_solr_service.sh --strip-components=2</code></pre>\n<p>Using this script we can install the service.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo bash ./install_solr_service.sh solr-5.1.0.tgz</code></pre>\n<p>The script will install Solr into /opt/solr-5.1.0, with a symbolic link from /opt/solr. All writable files (i.e. logs) are placed in /opt/solr. The service runs under the user ‘solr’, that will be created for this purpose. Check the service is running correctly.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo service solr status</code></pre>\n<p>Just to note, by default the Java heap size is 512M. This will more than likely need to be increased in a production environment. What this value will be will depend on your requirements, and is beyond the scope of this post. If you do need to amend this value, use an<em>or such as Vi to</em> the following file:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo vi /var/solr/solr.in.sh</code></pre>\n<p>The specific value you will need to change is SOLR_JAVA_MEM. Restart the service to make certain the new configuration is picked up.</p>\n<p>You should now be able to access the Solr admin site on the server. By default this runs on port 8983, for example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://your-server:8983/solr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://your-server:8983/solr/</a></p>\n<p>Now Solr is up and running we need to set up Zookeeper. Zookeeper is used to maintain the configuration between the three Solr servers.</p>\n<p>Once again we need to obtain a package from a Zookeeper mirror.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">get http://mirror.vorboss.net/apache/zookeeper/current/zookeeper-3.4.6.tar.gz</code></pre>\n<p>Zookeeper does not come with a nice service installer, so we need to manually set this up. First extract into /opt.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo tar xzxf zookeeper-3.4.6.tar.gz -C /opt</code></pre>\n<p>Create a symbolic link. This is for ease of upgrading.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo ln -s /opt/zookeeper-3.4.6/ /opt/zookeeper</code></pre>\n<p>Rename the example Zookeeper config file.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo mv /opt/zookeeper/conf/zoo_sample.cfg /opt/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg</code></pre>\n<p>You will need to add something like the following to zoo.cfg. These lines list all servers that need to be maintained by Zookeeper. Amend with applicable server IP addresses.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">server.1=serverip1:2888:3888\nserver.2=serverip2:2888:3888\nserver.3=serverip3:2888:3888</code></pre>\n<p>Whilst*ing this file, change the data directory:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">dataDir=/var/lib/zookeeper/data</code></pre>\n<p>Each server requires a context file called ‘myid’. This is used to identify it.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo mkdir /var/lib/zookeeper\nsudo mkdir /var/lib/zookeeper/data\nsudo touch /var/lib/zookeeper/data/myid</code></pre>\n<p>Edit each myid file and add the appropriate number for each server. For example, for three servers this will be 1, 2 or 3.</p>\n<p>Now start up each ZooKeeper server:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo /opt/zookeeper/bin/zkServer.sh start</code></pre>\n<p>We need to return to Solr, to configure the Zookeeper hosts.* the solr.xml file::</p>\n<p>sudo vi /var/solr/data/solr.xml</p>\n<p>Within the solrcloud element add the following, once again amending with your server IP addresses:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">serverip1:2181,serverip2:2182,serverip3:2183</code></pre>\n<p>It should look something like the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;solr&gt;\n  &lt;solrcloud&gt;\n    ...\n    &lt;str name=&quot;zkHost&quot;&gt;serverip1:2181,serverip2:2182,serverip3:2183&lt;/str&gt;\n  &lt;/solrcloud&gt;\n&lt;/solr&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Restart Solr on all servers managed by Zookeeper:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo service solr restart</code></pre>\n<p>We can check Solr is connected to Zookeeper, by obtaining its status.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo service solr status</code></pre>\n<p>There should be some additional JSON in the response returned:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&quot;cloud&quot;:{\n    &quot;ZooKeeper&quot;:&quot;serverip1:2181,serverip2:2182,serverip3:2183&quot;,\n    &quot;liveNodes&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,\n    &quot;collections&quot;:&quot;0&amp;&quot;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Now everything is working correct, we should create a start up script for Zookeeper. We are going to customise the zkServer.sh script. First copy to the start up scripts:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo cp /opt/zookeeper/bin/zkServer.sh /etc/init.d/zookeeper</code></pre>\n<p>Edit the copied file to include the following start up comment:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># chkconfig: - 20 80\n# description: starts zookeeper - /opt/zookeeper under user root</code></pre>\n<p>I also amended the path to the bin directory. Locate and* the following in the script:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ZOOBIN=/opt/zookeeper/bin</code></pre>\n<p>Now we can add the start up script, and switch it on:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo chkconfig --add /etc/init.d/zookeeper\nsudo chkconfig --level 2345 zookeeper on</code></pre>\n<p>These will give it the same start options as Solr.</p>\n<p>This should have Solr, and Zookeeper set up and installed on all three servers. You may have more servers if your requirements are more extensive. Bear in mind, Zookeeper requires an odd number of servers to function.</p>\n<p>As an addition to the post, we can now add a collection, and test that it is replicated across our Solr servers. I copied collection configuration from our development environment into the home directory of the user I managed the Solr servers with. I could then use this configuration to create my new collection.</p>\n<p>So to create a new collection, reference the uploaded collection configuration, so that it is stored in Zookeeper:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo /opt/solr/bin/solr create_collection -c collection-qa -d ~/collection-dev/conf -n collection-qa -shards 1 -replicationFactor 3</code></pre>\n<p>This created a collection called ‘collection-qa’, from the configuration I had uploaded into the ~/collection-dev/conf folder. For my purposes a wanted one shard, replicated over all three Solr servers.</p>\n<p>If you need to remove a collection use can use the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo /opt/solr/bin/solr delete -c collection-qa</code></pre>\n<p>All collection configuration files are now in Zookeeper. If you want to update this configuration, and not delete the how collection, you’ll need to use the Solr version of the Zookeeper CLI. It can be sound here:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo /opt/solr/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh</code></pre>\n<p>For example, to view the collection schema stored in Zookeeper, use:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo /opt/solr/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh -zkhost localhost:2181 -cmd get /configs/collection-qa/schema.xml</code></pre>\n<p>To upload an amended schema file to Zookeeper use:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo /opt/solr/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh -zkhost localhost:2181 -cmd putfile /configs/collection-qa/schema.xml collection-dev/conf/schema.xml</code></pre>\n<p>I’ve used the example file names, and locations as explained previously. You’ll need to amend for your purposes.</p>\n<p>If you do update the document schema you will need to reload a core using something like Curl to do the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo curl http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=RELOAD\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;core=collection-qa_shard1_replica3</code></pre>\n<p>I hope this has been useful, but appreciate that I might not be too clear on some instructions. If you need me to clarify anything, give us a shout.</p>\n<h2 id=\"48-thoughts-on-install-solr-5-and-zookeeper-in-a-production-environment\"><a href=\"#48-thoughts-on-install-solr-5-and-zookeeper-in-a-production-environment\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>48 thoughts on “Install Solr 5 and Zookeeper in a production environment”</h2>\n<h3 id=\"johnb\"><a href=\"#johnb\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>johnb</h3>\n<p><em>September 23, 2015 at 2:39 am</em></p>\n<p>Thanks for the effort!

You have to use the zkCli.sh command to access the data. If you look that up you will see how it’s done.</p>\n<p>As for uploading the config to zookeeper, there is a zkCli.sh on SOLR too (confusing I know) and you can use this to upload configs to Zookeeper.</p>\n<p>Here is a sample command line:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo /opt/solr/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh -cmd upconfig -confdir /home/john/conf/ -confname collectionName -z 192.168.56.5/solr5_4</code></pre>\n<p>The -z is worth noting… If, like me, you are using Zookeeper for several different purposes, you’ll want that /something after the zookeeper IP address… If you don’t do that, EVERYTHING ends up on the “/” level of Zookeeper’s internal storage and that will be very confusing later.</p>\n<p>I currently have the following in Zookeeper: /solr4.9, a /solr5.4, a /kafka, and a /microservice/microserviceName. Doing it this way keeps things nicely separated.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"johnb-3\"><a href=\"#johnb-3\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>johnb</h3>\n<p><em>March 10, 2016 at 10:43 pm</em></p>\n<p>Oh, and in the command line above, the /home/john/conf folder was a copy of a previously-existing SOLR conf folder. IIRC you only need schema.xml and solrconfig.xml, but don’t hold me to that.</p>\n<p>Also, this command will CREATE the /solr5_4 “directory” in Zookeeper if it doesn’t exist. You can use the Zookeeper /bin/zkCli.sh tool to verify that. After it’s running type “ls /” (no quotes) and you should see that solr5_4 (or whatever you put) directory.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"michael\"><a href=\"#michael\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Michael</h3>\n<p><em>March 6, 2016 at 11:19 am</em></p>\n<p>Hi Andy,\nFirst: thanks a lot it’s the best tutorial for this task.\nIf I need to create 5 solr instances I need to install zookeeper on each one of them?\nBests,\nMichael</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"johnb-4\"><a href=\"#johnb-4\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>johnb</h3>\n<p><em>March 10, 2016 at 5:33 pm</em></p>\n<p>No. In a production-like environment, you probably want your Zookeeper “cluster” separate anyway – although the online documentation about how to do that (SOLR Cloud) is sorely lacking.</p>\n<p>A minimum of 3 Zookeeper machines are required for a proper Zookeeper “cluster”</p>\n<p>Of course, you could do it that way, but you’d be multiplying the number of zookeeper instances in your environment beyond what you absolutely need.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"johnb-5\"><a href=\"#johnb-5\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>johnb</h3>\n<p><em>March 10, 2016 at 6:10 pm</em></p>\n<p>By the way – you’ll need to start or restart your SOLR process in a way that points it at the correct Zookeeper instances.

Happy to contribute. Your post here saved me a lot of time once I found it.</p>\n<p>I spent two months pulling my hair out getting SOLR Cloud, Zookeeper and Kafka actually working on separate VM’s — NOT on loopback. The documentation for this is basically nonexistent and the “magic” script the SOLR folks created to get SOLR Cloud running on loopback is no help.</p>\n<p>Why does nearly every open source project do that? Showing people how to build things on loopback is (in my not so humble opinion) a cop-out and a waste of time. It usually provides none of the information you need to actually build things in Prod or convince IT that the tool is a good idea. SOLR in particular has a bit of a bad reputation in terms of being so difficult to install and configure. A complete basic tutorial on how to set up a small Zookeeper cluster and 2 SOLR instances on separate VMs would go a looong way toward changing that.</p>\n<p>Heck, what about providing Virtual Box images of everything in a working state? It surely would not take the SOLR experts that much longer to build…</p>\n<p>If I can squeeze it in, I’m going to set up some AWS images and make them available… If I get really ambitious, I may do the whole thing as a Udemy course…</p>\n<p>Anyway — It’s all fresh in my mind and I’ll be working on this project for another year, so I’m happy to help.

I have no idea how it works on Windows. Your milage may vary.</p>\n<p>There may be several approaches.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In theory you could create cores using the Admin UI. I have no idea how this works on windows. I haven’t successfully created new cores and had them tie into the existing collection “cloud” although it seems that it should be possible. That’s an approach I still need to test and verify – as I’m more a command-line guy myself. The trick with the Admin UI is that whatever code it runs (on linux at least) expects a particular directory structure to exist – and if it doesn’t find that structure things get confusing fast. On Linux this was /var/solr/data – I have no idea what it is on Windows. I figured this out by trying to build one and looking at the error message that came back – the directory SOLR was looking for was part of the message.</li>\n<li>Another approach would be to start from scratch and use the command line to make SOLR do everything for 3 or 4 machines all at once (I’ve done this on Linux and it appears to work fine) The machines have to be up and running with SOLR also running and connected to Zookeeper in “cloud” mode.</li>\n<li>The other approach is to stop SOLR on each of the machines you want to add a test core to — and then add (or copy) a directory where SOLR expects to see it on each of the new machines (it’s /var/solr/data on Linux) and then add a core.properties text file inside that directory that is very close to the one you should see inside the directory for your current “test” core.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am in the middle of documenting this (for Linux) and will be happy to share what I found. The docs are quite rough and un-edited — and also lengthy. What I should do is get them up on a blog of my own, but as I say, they’re not yet done.</p>\n<p>I will put rough docs for approach #3 here. If these turn out to be unreadable due to formatting, give me your email address and I’ll send a text file.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind:</p>\n<p>For Linux, not Windows so your milage may vary.\nI believe there are analogues for the .sh files for Windows command line work.\nVery rough docs, but should be enough to get you through.\nstatdx is the name of my collection\nif you are NOT doing this kind of thing with your addressing in Zookeeper, you’ll probably be sorry later and should probably start from scratch.

I would strongly recommend asking the support mailing list by signing up here: solr-user-subscribe@lucene.apache.org.</p>\n<p>You could check by trying the import and watching the log file(s) for the nodes and seeing if they’re all working on indexing or only one is working on indexing. The log entries should make it clear whether any particular node is indexing…</p>\n<p>If it is NOT the case that your two hours is the best that you can get and in fact only one node is indexing the incoming data, then you could probably use SolrJ (the API) and have 3 threads or three separate java processes each handling 1/3 of the data in some way and each pointing at a different Solr node. This will require multi-threading your code or, as I say, having 3 separate Java processes running at once (easier since you don’t have to worry about concurrency etc…)</p>\n<p>If your Solr nodes can get to your SQL database (in terms of networking) you could put a Java process on each SOLR box and have it go after a clearly-defined subsection of the data and put that data into the SOLR node on that box.</p>\n<p>Again – I’m not sure how SOLR cloud handles this, so I’d verify what’s going on in your 2 hour scenario before I started writing code — since if Solr Cloud is already splitting up the work, your efforts would be wasted.</p>\n<p>Here is the page URL where I found the link to the mailing list and other helpful information: <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/resources.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://lucene.apache.org/solr/resources.html</a></p>\n<p>A final suggestion – make sure you understand how long each part of your data loading process is taking. Don’t assume that SOLR is the biggest time sink until you’ve verified. How long does your SQL query take to return data by itself? Would there be value in putting all that data in a text file or some other form and then grabbing that data to pump into Solr?</p>\n<p>My own data loading process takes far, far too long – but it’s mostly about the database work and turning those documents into solr docs. What I did to “solve” this is to write code that puts the resulting solr docs into a text file.</p>\n<p>In this way, I only have to run the database query side of things once – and I can trigger it the night before I need it. The time it takes to pick up the text file and dump it into Solr is orders of magnitude shorter than if I ran the whole process every time.</p>\n<p>It takes roughly an hour to query the database, turn the info into solr doc xml and put that into a text file. It takes less than 10 minutes to push the contents of the text file into Solr – which I do frequently because I’m still working on relevance and need to re-index frequently. Of course, my data is static and not changing – this scenario may not match yours...</p>\n<p>Hope that helps...</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"tarikur-rahaman-2\"><a href=\"#tarikur-rahaman-2\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Tarikur Rahaman</h3>\n<p><em>April 8, 2016 at 7:52 am</em></p>\n<p>Hi, I was able to create solrcloud with zookeeper.
