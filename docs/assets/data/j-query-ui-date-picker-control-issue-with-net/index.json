It's ace. The newly released <a href=\"https://jqueryui.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">jQuery UI</a> is pretty special too. One of the many great widgets is the Date Picker control.</p>\n<p>I build many .net applications that require date entry, so I implement the Date Picker control often. Unfortunately, there is a problem when it is used on a field that is validated using a .Net validation control. Upon clicking on a date, I get the following error:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">length is null or not an object</code></pre>\n<p>This only occurs when using Internet Explorer. Currently, my only solution is to edit the source code. Locate the following code in <strong>jquery-ui.js</strong> or <strong>ui.datepicker.js</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">inst.input.trigger(&#39;change&#39;)</code></pre>\n<p>Replace it with:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">if (!$.browser.msie){inst.input.trigger(&#39;change&#39;)}</code></pre>\n<p>This prevents the change event firing in IE.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't normally advocate changing source code in this manner, as it makes future upgrades tedious. Hopefully it will be addressed in a future release.</p>\n","cover_image":null}},"context":{}}
