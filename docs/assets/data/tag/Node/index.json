Almost all of then use <a href=\"https://find.episerver.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Episerver Find</a> to index content.</p>\n<p>Episerver do not provide an API to automate the creation of new indices. As I was messing around with <a href=\"https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Puppeteer</a> and headless Chrome, I thought I’d knock up a tool to do this. You can find the code in my <a href=\"https://github.com/ajrowland/create-episerver-find-index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Github repo</a>.</p>\n<p>Using your favourite shell, clone the repo:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git clone https://github.com/ajrowland/create-episerver-find-index.git\ncd create-episerver-find-index</code></pre>\n<p>Install dependencies:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npm install</code></pre>\n<p>You’ll need to create a <a href=\"https://find.episerver.com/Account/Register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">developer account for Find</a>. Once this is done, you can create an index with the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">node createindex.js --username [username] --password [password] --indexname [indexname]</code></pre>\n<p>The script returns the configuration for the newly created index, or an existing index if it already exists.</p>\n<p>Ultimately I hope to use something like this within a continuous integration, or deployment pipeline, to make certain a valid index is available for the application.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
