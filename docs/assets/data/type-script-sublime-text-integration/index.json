Of all people, the folk at Microsoft have developed TypeScript. If you’re in to such things, I don’t need to explain further. There is a Visual Studio 2012 plugin, but these days I’ve fallen in love with Sublime Text. Here’s a quick howto on TypeScript development with Sublime Text, specifically on Windows 7.</p>\n<p>First install theNode.jsmsi package. Once installed, open a command prompt and type the following to install the TypeScript compiler:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npm install -g typescript</code></pre>\n<p>Now grab the Sublime Text syntax hightlight definition file from MSDN. Open the zip and copy the <em>typescript.tmplanguage</em> file to your Sublime Text user packages directory. Mine is located in:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">C:\\Users\\arowland\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sublime Text 2\\Packages\\User\\</code></pre>\n<p>Now open Sublime Text. Select <strong>Tools -> Build System -> New Build System</strong>. Paste in the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">{\n    &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;source.ts&quot;,\n    &quot;cmd&quot;: [&quot;tsc.cmd&quot;, &quot;$file&quot;],\n    &quot;file_regex&quot;: &quot;^(.+?) \\\\((\\\\d+),(\\\\d+)\\\\): (.+)$&quot;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Save this file. Now you can create a new JavaScript file, and save with the .ts extension. The editor will highlight TypeScript code, and allow you to compile to JavaScript by pressing <strong>Ctrl+B</strong>. The build process will create the compiled JavaScript file in the same directory as the source TypeScript.</p>\n","cover_image":null,"comments":[]}},"context":{}}
