Not posted in a while as I've plenty going on in the 'real' world. Anyway, last week I was building a search form whereby you could either search by reference code, or by using full search criteria.</p>\n<p>The problem I had is that both search 'forms' existed on one Web Form, and I was using Validation controls to check each. So when using either submit button, both search groups were validated together. Not useful when I wanted to submit each set of controls independently of each other. So there I was, coding to disable either set of validation controls when a submit button is clicked.</p>\n<p>Validation groups I hear you cry. Yes, I know that now.</p>\n<p>Add the ValidationGroup attribute to all controls, so you can group them together, and submit them separately from other groups. Example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;form id=&quot;form1&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    &lt;asp:TextBox Id=&quot;TextBox1&quot; Runat=&quot;server&quot; ValidationGroup=&quot;First&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;asp:TextBox Id=&quot;TextBox2&quot; Runat=&quot;server&quot; ValidationGroup=&quot;First&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;asp:RequiredFieldValidator Id=&quot;RequiredFieldValidator1&quot; Runat=&quot;server&quot; ValidationGroup=&quot;First&quot; ErrorMessage=&quot;TextBox1 should not be blank&quot; ControlToValidate=&quot;TextBox1&quot; /&gt;\n\n    &lt;asp:Button ID=&quot;Submit1&quot; Runat=&quot;server&quot; ValidationGroup=&quot;First&quot; Text=&quot;Submit 1&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    &lt;asp:TextBox Id=&quot;TextBox3&quot; Runat=&quot;server&quot; ValidationGroup=&quot;Second&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;asp:TextBox Id=&quot;TextBox4&quot; Runat=&quot;server&quot; ValidationGroup=&quot;Second&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;asp:RequiredFieldValidator Id=&quot;RequiredFieldValidator2&quot; Runat=&quot;server&quot; ErrorMessage=&quot; TextBox3 should not be blank&quot; ControlToValidate=&quot;TextBox3&quot; ValidationGroup=&quot;Second&quot; /&gt;\n\n    &lt;asp:Button Id=&quot;Submit2&quot; Runat=&quot;server&quot; ValidationGroup=&quot;Second&quot; Text=&quot;Submit 2&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Aye, easy when you know. Googling is a wonderful thing.</p>\n","cover_image":null}},"context":{}}
