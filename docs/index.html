Like most aspects of coding, using a framework to do all the heavy lifting, rather than developing your own, is a sensible approach.
So today I took a look at jQuery, a JavaScript framework. I have to admit, I'm pretty impressed. It did not take me long to come up with some example code, that degrades well when JavaScript is disabled in the browser.</p><div class="post-meta post-card__meta">
