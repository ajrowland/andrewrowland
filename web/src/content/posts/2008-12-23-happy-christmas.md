I've finally got some time off from work. Not managed to update the blog for a few months, which is a shame, because I quite enjoy doing it. I've also had a few emails from satisfied customers. Some of you out there actually take the time to post feedback. Much appreciated. Though I had to code a spam filter for naughty stuff that had been submitted. Thankfully I now don't have to go into the database, and bulk delete entries.

Now that I've got the time, I'm going to start writing again. I start work again in the new year, and I'm looking forward to it. As things never stand still in development, it'll be time to pick up a few books, and gain some new skills.

More Content Management integration coming up for me next year ([Tridion](https://www.sdl.com/), possibly Immediacy), and more [ASP.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) work. Also going to brush up on my [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/) knowledge. Really would like to do more Open Source based project work, as I've been mainly using proprietary applications during the pass few months. With the economy lower than a fat kids self esteem, I can't be choosy, just glad to be working.

Have a great Christmas, and I'll see you a few pounds heavier in the new year.
